## Description
This is a REINFORCEMENT LEARNING project: to learn a good strategy for a one-player game of find-the-source

The goal of this project is to (a) build a very simple simulator for a robot endowed with a chemical sense—an electronic nose—in an environment with odor sources; and (b) make a controller to allow the robot to follow the scent trail to the source. The simulator should allow different conditions, like wind and turbulence, various noise levels in the sensor, and various sensor geometries. The chemotactic strategy would be not hand-built, but learned, using reinforcement learning. If it’s possible to see how the strategy varies under different conditions, that would be a publishable result.
