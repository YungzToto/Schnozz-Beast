## Description
This is a REINFORCEMENT LEARNING project: to learn a good strategy for a one-player game of find-the-source

The goal of this project is to (a) build a very simple simulator for a robot endowed with a chemical sense—an electronic nose—in an environment with odor sources; and (b) make a controller to allow the robot to follow the scent trail to the source. The simulator should allow different conditions, like wind and turbulence, various noise levels in the sensor, and various sensor geometries. The chemotactic strategy would be not hand-built, but learned, using reinforcement learning. If it’s possible to see how the strategy varies under different conditions, that would be a publishable result.

## Tech Stack
Godot 4 (Game Engine), GDScript (an in built language within Godot 4 that is similar to python). How it differs from Python is that it has its own in built functions that affect factors such as player behaviour within a Godot made game.

## Research Done
-> Looked up Godot game tutorials on Youtube and would learn different techniques such as creating nodes that would influence the creation of the player such as movement and animations. The creation of the world would factor in here too.

-> Researched articles on ML agents in Godot and how they're used and what reinforcement learning is. I also worked on how I could implement the scent trail mechanics from the project description into the game as well.
